# Nue FAQ

## Frequently asked questions

### Who are you?
I'm [Tero Piirainen](//twitter.com/tipiirai), a JavaScript and UX developer from **Helsinki**. I've been around for 25+ years founding startups and creating open-source projects. I'm known for [Riot.js](//riot.js.org/), **Flowplayer**, and **jQuery Tools**. Right now I'm focusing solely on Nue, which is by far the most ambitious project I've started.

### Why start all this?
Because the current [frontend stack](//roadmap.sh/frontend) has too many redundant layers. We need a simpler way to build websites and single-page applications, and we must bring UX development back to the forefront.


### Who is this a bad fit?
Nue is a bad fit for developers who are not interested in learning CSS. They rather use JavaScript or TypeScript for everything, or they just want to stay away from design and UX development alltogether.

### What is the ultimate goal?
The ultimate goal of Nue is to build [a perfect web framework](/blog/perfect-web-framework/) for UX developers. A simpler alternative to **Next.js**, **Vercel** and **Netlify**.


### Isn't this just another web framework?
On the contrary. Nue is currently the *only* framework for UX developers.

### How to migrate a large JavaScript codebase to Nue?
By leaving out the redundant JavaScript components between your design system and the CSS code, and by assembling your content with the extended Markdown syntax. It's likely a full rewrite, but you are rewarded with a significantly simpler and faster stack.


### What are the risks if Nue goes out of existence?
The code you'll write is semantic HTML/CSS, progressively enhanced with JavaScript. That's how the web works. It's a universal way to build websites. You'll invest on skills that benefit you for years to come.


### Any plans to profit?
Yes. With pixel-perfect, easy-to-use templates for individuals, businesses, and design agencies. The well-organized and commented CSS code contains decades of experience and tons of useful tricks.


### Who are your inspirations?

- **Steve Jobs**. The greatest UX developer ever existed.

- **Mies van der Rohe**. His philosophy; "Less is more" defines my thinking.

- **Jarred Sumner** for [Bun](//bun.sh). It showcases the power of dreaming big.

- **Salvatore Sanfilippo** for the inspirational [coding style](//github.com/redis/redis/tree/unstable/src).


### Where does the word "Nue" come from?
