# Hello, World!
In this tutorial, you’ll see some Nue's key features by building a fully functioning blog from scratch.

## Create your first page
First, we create a folder for our project and add a page in there:

```sh
# create a folder for the project
mkdir simple-blog

# go to the directory
cd simple-blog

# create the first page
echo '# Hello, World!' > index.md
```

Done. Our first Nue application is ready. You can run it by running `nue` inside the directory:

```sh
# Start nue in "watch" mode
nue
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/` with your browser and you'll see this:

[image]
  small: /img/hello-world.png
  large: /img/hello-world-big.png
  width: 600


### HTML source
Let's view the source code of that page at `view-source:http://localhost:8080/`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello, World!</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
>   <script src="/@nue/hotreload.js" type="module"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Nue auto-generates an HTML skeleton, with basic meta tags and the page title, which is automatically parsed from the Markdown content.

The nicest thing, however, is the "hotreload.js" module, which is the key benefit of choosing Nue for your web development environment.


### Hot-reloading
Let's add a new file to our project folder called "blog.css", which will take care of the styling:


```sh
# add a CSS file
touch blog.css
```

Nue automatically adds the following line on the HTML without the need to reload your page:

```html
<link href="/blog.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Now, as you edit either of your files (blog.css or index.md) on your text editor you can see the browser magically morphing with your changes.

// TODO: video: completing the page the first page

Instead of making a full reload, Nue uses a technique called **DOM diffing** to only update the parts on the page that have changed. Be it the content, metadata, styling, global headers and footers, page layouts, or reactive components.


### Frontmatter
Next, we add some metadata for the page for SEO and social sharing purposes. We do this by adding a so-called "front matter" at the beginning of our Markdown page. This is a YAML-formatted section with human-readable key/value pairs:

```md
\---
title: "Hello, World!"
description: "Just playing with with hot-reloading"
\---

# Hello, World!
```

Again, as you edit the metadata you can see your page title change on the browser tab.


### Complete the page
Next we style the page with Nue's [CSS best practices](css-best-practices.html) while enjoying the power of hot-reloading. You can watch the page evolve on the browser from start to finish.

## A blogging app
Next we turn our blog into something more usable


### Add headers and footers
We start by creating a [custom layout file](custom-layouts.html) called `layout.html` and add our global header and footer to it:


```html
<!-- global header -->
<header>
  <a href="/"><img :src="avatar"></a>
  <nav>
    <a :for="el in social" :href="el.url">
      <img class="icon" src="/img/{el.icon}.svg">
    </a>
  </nav>
</header>

<!-- global footer -->
<footer>
  <p>© { fullname } • { new Date().getFullYear() }</p>
  <q>{ slogan }</q>
</footer>
```


### Add shared data
Then we add a data file called `site.yaml` with all the site-wide data to fill in our personal information and other basic data being used on our header and footer:


```yaml
# shared data for all pages
fullname: Emma Bennet
slogan: Less is More
avatar: /img/emma.jpg
favicon: /img/favicon.jpg


# the social icons on the header
social:
  - icon: email
    url: email:emma@bennet.co
    alt: Emma Bennet email address
  - icon: twitter
    url: //twitter.com/tipiirai
    alt: Twitter profile
  - icon: github
    url: //github.com/nuejs/
    alt: Github projects
```

You can see your page headers and footers update on your browser as you edit the layout or the data file. The header and footer are inherited from the root level `layout.html`


### Add page layout
Next, we add a `<main>` element to the layout file to render the "hero" area for our blog entries. This will render data from the Markdown pages (front matter area) and if not present, then the data is taken from the `site.yaml` file.

```html
<!-- in layout.html: -->
<main>

  <h1>{ title }</h1>

  <p>
    <pretty-date :date/> (by AI) •
    Photo credits: <a href="//dribbble.com/{ credits }">{ credits }</a>
  </p>

  <img class="hero" :src="hero"
    width="1000" height="800"
    alt="Hero image for { title }">

  <article>

    <!-- slot for the Markdown content -->
>   <slot for="content"/>

  </article>

</main>
```


### Add all the pages
Next, we add two more pages to the directory. Each one will share the same header, footer, page layout, and styling. Here's what we have at this point:

[image]
  small: /img/blog-entries.png
  large: /img/blog-entries-big.png
  width: 650

Pretty good. Of course, hot-reloading was there to provide a great content authoring and styling experience for all the pages.



### Create a blog index
Next, we move all our pages to the `posts` folder to make room for our new front page, which lists all our entries from newest to latest. Nue treats the `posts` directory as a separate *multi-page application* that can be configured with its layout and styling.

We also add a new `global` folder to hold all our global components and styles. The root directory has assets for the front page only, and the `posts` directory has assets for our blog entries only. Here's what our folder structure looks like:

[image.gridpaper]
  small: /img/blog-dirs.png
  large: /img/blog-dirs-big.png

Here's our new front page/index.md:

[code numbered language="md"]
  \---
  title: "Emma Bennet Blog"
  description: "Design, UX development, and minimalism"
  |content_collection: posts
  \---

  # Minimalist, UX engineer, designer, urban explorer.
  I’m Emma Bennett, a user experience designer and developer from Berlin.
  Here are my thoughts on design, UX engineering, and product thinking.


The page is configured with a new [content collection](content-collections.html) option to hold information on all our pages on the `posts`- folder. We use this information to render the posts on our updated `layout.html` file:

```html
<!-- front page main layout -->
<main>
  <!-- slot for the Markdown content -->
  <slot for="content"/>

  <!-- list of blog posts by looping the "posts" variable  -->
> <a :for="post in posts" :href="post.url">
    <img src="{ post.dir }/{ post.hero }">
    <aside>
      <h2>{ post.title }</h2>
      <p>{ post.pubDate }</p>
    </aside>
  </a>
</main>

<!-- headers and footers like before -->
<header>
  ...
</header>

<footer>
  ...
</footer>
```

And here's our resulting blog index page:

[image]
  small: /img/blog-index.png
  large: /img/blog-index-big.png
  width: 500


## Reactivity

Next, we add an interactive feedback component that can be opened from a chat icon on the bottom/right corner of the page.

[image]
  small: /img/feedback-component.png
  large: /img/feedback-component-big.png
  width: 650

Interactive components are created with the same kind of HTML-based template language that is used for defining the server-side layouts:

```html
<!-- file: feedback.nue -->

<dialog @name="feedback-dialog">
  <a class="close" @click="root.close()">&times;</a>

  <div :if="thanks" class="thanks">
    <h2>Thank you!</h2>
  </div>

  <form @submit.prevent="submit" :else>
    <h2>Give us feedback</h2>

    <div>
      <h3>Your name</h3>
      <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Example: John Doe" required>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Your email</h3>
      <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="your@email.com" required>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Your thoughts</h3>
      <textarea name="feedback" placeholder="Type here..."/>
    </div>

    <button>Submit</button>

  </form>

  <script>
    submit({ target }) {
      this.thanks = true
    }
  </script>

</dialog>
```

### Add dialog launcher
Then we add the component to the footer and add a trigger element that opens up the dialog:

```html
<!-- file: ./layout.html -->

<footer>
  <a href="/">© { fullname }</a>
  <strong>{ slogan }</strong>

  <!-- feedback dialog is automatically mounted here -->
  <feedback-dialog id="feedback"/>

  <!-- feedback launcher using the native .showModal() method -->
  <img src="/img/feedback.svg" onclick="feedback.showModal()">
</footer>
```

Needless to say, that hot-reloading facility is there again to speed up development. The dialog is not only updating live, but also the potential form values are retained and the dialog remains open while we make changes.


## Build for production
Our blog is now ready. It's time to build a minified production version:

[image]
  small: /img/blog-build.png
  large: /img/blog-build-big.png
  width: 600


We can also preview the production version at `http://localhost:8081`

```sh
nue serve --production
```

You can now push the production version at `.dist/prod` to some public server. You currently need to do this manually before the official deployment tool is available.
