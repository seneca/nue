title: Because web development used to be *FUN!*
desc: Why I'm building a complete frontend ecosystem from scratch

I still remember the exact moment when I discovered **jQuery**. It was a revelation: can I suddenly add logic to my pages in the same way I add styling?

I surely can. This is going to be huge!

And it was: in the following years we got introduced to groundbreaking concepts like **separation of concerns**, **progressive enhancement**, and **responsive web design**. Things were great.


## Then it changed { #then }

Developers discovered **React** and single-page applications. **Facebook** took over . Slowly but steadily **JavaScript** took control of everything: logic, layout, styling were bundled together. CSS was ditched, because of the fear of "global namespace pollution". Content-heavy websites were developed like they were single-page apps. Eventually, JS engineers won, [UX developers][divide] lost, and the old foundation was gone.


## The magic is still there { #magic }

First, we must recognize that a content-focused website is a whole different beast than a single-page application. Secondly, we need to understand that UX development is a whole [different field][brad] from JS development. The goals, skillsets, and interests are different.

Nue is an ambitious attempt to change the status quo. It offers drastically simpler tooling for both JS and UX developers. It brings UX developers back to the forefront. With Nue, everyone can become a professional web developer without the burden of the JavaScript ecosystem.

You begin to wonder why you ever built website any other way.

### Peace ❤️
